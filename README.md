**Amazon Cart Automation**
This project demonstrates how to automate the process of searching for "car accessories" on Amazon, selecting the first item, adding it to the cart, and verifying that the item has been successfully added.

**Prerequisites**
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Maven (if using for dependency management)
- WebDriver for your preferred browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome)
- Selenium WebDriver library

**Set up your environment:**
Make sure you have the necessary WebDriver for your browser and set the path in your code.
If you're using Maven, add the Selenium dependency to your pom.xml

**Notes**
Ensure you have a stable internet connection for the automation to work smoothly.
Depending on your browser settings, you might need to handle pop-ups or sign-in prompts.
Adjust the element selectors if there are any changes to the Amazon page layout.
